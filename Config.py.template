#NOTE: How to use actions.
# To use actions you need to have an object that has a name following a specific format.
# First, the name has to have the "activation keyword" by default its atomicBuild
# Then, you must put down the seperator, "_" this tells the program what is one thing and what is not.
# Then, you must provide the operation you want to perform (e.g. paste)
# After that, you have to provide the paramaters that the specific operation requires. (e.g. paste requires a preset name and paste center coordinates.)
#NOTE: The paramaters for each operation can be found in the actions dictionary in the Actions.py file in this same directory.
# Here is an example request. This request will paste an archangel class heli-carrier, onto a units position.
# atomicBuild_paste_archangel_CURR|LOC
#  ^keyword    ^op   ^preset name  ^paste center coords

#NOTE: If a paramater can take multiple inputs / numbers, its seperator will be ",", for example, to group units into an objective, you might want to filter for specific units.
# the paramater for filtering HLT-R trucks and Shards would be the following. "HLT-R,Corvette1"
